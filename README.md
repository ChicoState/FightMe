# Sprint 1 Goals:

- Create a basic backend that stores messages and retrieves stored messages
- Create a basic front end that displays messages and can be used to send messages
- If possible set up authentication for different users

# Sprint 2 Goals: 

- More interactions with user scores
    - Multiple user gamerscores, attack scores, and defense scores
- Fight button is turn based
- Profile picture / Avatar implementation
- Being able to gain / lose points 
    - Do something to stop spam and botting somehow
    - Gameifying engagement
- Authentication 
    - login signup 
- Friend request / Find other people
- Update backend to handle read messages

# Sprint 3 Goals: 

- Main Fight game implementation with game logic (rock-paper-scissors type)
    - Use the profile pictures to display each user.
- UI themes that are customizable and can be bought from the shop
    - Light/Dark theme, anime?, colorful themes.
- Profile pictures that are preset and can be bought from the shop (maybe earned as well)
- Display some interesting stats in the profile page
    - Display hours played on a game, etc ...
- Make the training game to train up stats.
    - Maybe like a dungeon MMO type game where you clear stages of a dungeon and beat a boss for the final stats.
    - WebSockets
- CI with Unit Testing
- HAVE A LISTENER SO THE UI MATCHES THE BACKEND WITHOUT HAVING TO REFRESH TO SEE THINGS UPDATED

# Programs Used
- Flutter
- Spring Boot
- Postgresql
